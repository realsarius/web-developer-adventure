# CSS Layout - The display Property

The display property is the most important CSS property for controlling layout.

Every HTML element has a default display value depending on what type of element it is. The default display value for most elements is `block` or `inline`.

### Block-level Elements

A block-level element always starts on a new line and takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).


 - `<div>`
 - `<h1>` - `<h6>`
 - `<p>`
 - `<form>`
 - `<header>`
 - `<footer>`
 - `<section>`

### Inline Elements

An inline element does not start on a new line and only takes up as much width as necessary.

Examples of inline elements:

 - `<span>`
 - `<a>`
 - `<img>`

### Display: none;
