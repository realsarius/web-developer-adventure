# CSS Flexbox

Before the Flexbox Layout module, there were four layout modes:

 - Block, for sections in a webpage
 - Inline, for text
 - Table, for two-dimensional table data
 - Positioned, for explicit position of an element

The Flexible Box Layout Module, makes it easier to design flexible responsive layout structure without using float or positioning.
