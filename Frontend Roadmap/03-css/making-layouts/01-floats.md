# CSS Layout - float and clear

The CSS float property specifies how an element should float.


The float property can have one of the following values:

    left - The element floats to the left of its container
    right - The element floats to the right of its container
    none - The element does not float (will be displayed just where it occurs in the text). This is default
    inherit - The element inherits the float value of its parent
