# Variables

Most of the time, a JavaScript application needs to work with information. Here are two examples:

 - An online shop – the information might include goods being sold and a shopping cart.
 - 2.A chat application – the information might include users, messages, and much more.

Variables are used to store this information.

### A variable

To create a variable in JavaScript, use the let keyword.

    let user = 'John';
    let age = 25;
    let message = 'Hello';

### Data Types

undefined, null, boolean, string, symbol, number, and object

### Constants

Variables declared using const are called “constants”. They cannot be reassigned. An attempt to do so would cause an error.

    const myBirthday = '18.04.1982';
