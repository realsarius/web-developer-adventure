# Basic operators, maths

We know many operators from school. They are things like addition +, multiplication *, subtraction -, and so on.

### Terms: “unary”, “binary”, “operand”

 - An **operand** – is what operators are applied to. In 5 * 2, 5 is left and 2 is right operand.
 - An **operator** is unary if it has a single operand. For example, the unary negation - reverses the sign of a number:


    let x = 1;

    x = -x;
    alert( x ); // -1, unary negation was applied

 - An operator is binary if it has two operands. The same minus exists in binary form as well:


    let x = 1, y = 3;
    alert( y - x ); // 2, binary minus subtracts values

### Increment/decrement

 - When the operator goes after the variable, it is in “postfix form”: counter++
 - The “prefix form” is when the operator goes before the variable: ++counter.

The prefix form returns the new value while the postfix form returns the old value.

    let counter = 1;
    let a = ++counter; // (*)

    alert(a); // 2
    ---
    let counter = 1;
    let a = counter++; // (*) changed ++counter to counter++

    alert(a); // 1
