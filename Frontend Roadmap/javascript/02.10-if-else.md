# Conditional branching: if, '?'

Sometimes, we need to perform different actions based on different conditions.

To do that, we can use the if statement and the conditional operator ?, that’s also called a “question mark” operator.

### The “if” statement

    let year = prompt('In which year was ECMAScript-2015 specification published?', '');

    if (year == 2015) alert( 'You are right!' );
    ---
    if (year == 2015) {
    alert( "That's correct!" );
    alert( "You're so smart!" );
    }

### Boolean conversion

The if (…) statement evaluates the expression in its parentheses and converts the result to a boolean.

 - A number 0, an empty string "", null, undefined, and NaN all become false. Because of that they are called “falsy” values.

### Several conditions: “else if”

let year = prompt('In which year was the ECMAScript-2015 specification published?', '');

    if (year < 2015) {
      alert( 'Too early...' );
    } else if (year > 2015) {
      alert( 'Too late' );
    } else {
      alert( 'Exactly!' );
    }

### Conditional operator ‘?’

    let accessAllowed = (age > 18) ? true : false;
    ---
    let age = prompt('age?', 18);

    let message = (age < 3) ? 'Hi, baby!' :
      (age < 18) ? 'Hello!' :
      (age < 100) ? 'Greetings!' :
      'What an unusual age!';

    alert( message );
