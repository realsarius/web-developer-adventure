# Introduction

Internet is a wire, buried under the ground. Two computers connected directly to this wire can communicate.

### Where to Begin? Internet Addresses

Because the Internet is a global network of computers each computer connected to the <b>Internet must have a unique address</b>. Internet addresses are in the form `nnn.nnn.nnn.nnn` where nnn must be a number from 0 - 255. This address is known as an IP address. (IP stands for Internet Protocol; more on this later.)
