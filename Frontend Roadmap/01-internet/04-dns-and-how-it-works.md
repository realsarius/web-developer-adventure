# DNS and how it works?

What is the definition of DNS?

DNS, which stands for Domain Name System, is used as the medium to translate domain names to their respective IP addresses when a client initiates a request query. **DNS stores the database of all the domain names and their IP addresses which are registered on the network.**

Similar thing happens in working of DNS: when you type the website name in your browser, the browser sends a request to the DNS server, if the website domain name is registered in the database with the DNS, then it’ll reply you with the IP address of the website you are trying to access, which is something like 117.234.214.14

Siteye girmek istediğimizde o websiteye ait ip'yi almak için DNS ile sorguluyor

"domain adı ile ip adres arasındaki bağlantı"

Now, if someone wants to know the domain name registered against an IP address, he will request the DNS server with the IP address of the website. Say, the IP address sent is  31.13.79.246, the DNS will first check the 31 then 13 then 79 and finally 246, concluding that the IP address belongs to www.fb.com
